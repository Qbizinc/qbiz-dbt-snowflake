The Gold layer, or Reporting/Data Mart area, is for business rule specific tables. The primary purpose of these tables is to provide code reuse for reporting as well as a central source of truth for heavily transformed data designed to meet specific business needs.

QBiz best practices are that any data with very specific business rule oriented transformations, as well as things like time series, aggregations, and the like, belong at this layer.
