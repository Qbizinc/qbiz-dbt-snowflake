The Silver layer, or Analytical/Warehouse area, is for data that has been transformed for analytical purposes. The primary purpose of these tables is to configure the source data in a way that is easily joinable and scalable for reporting performance.

QBiz best practices are for the bulk of data transformations to be done at this layer. In addition, we recommend that the schema be organized using a Star Schema (Fact & Dimension) or similar approach.
